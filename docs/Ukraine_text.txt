The United States has announced a $250m military aid package for war-torn Ukraine to strengthen the country's naval and land capabilities. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the US would also provide Ukraine with naval training, as well as sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, radars and night vision equipment. "The United States remains committed to helping Ukraine ... to strengthen democratic civilian control of the military, promote command and control reforms, enhance transparency and accountability in acquisition and budgeting, and advance defence industry reforms," Lieutenant Colonel Carla M Gleason, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. "These reforms will bolster Ukraine's ability to defend its territorial integrity in support of a secure, prosperous, democratic and free Ukraine," Gleason added. According to the statement, the amount is part of a series of Pentagon payments totalling $1.5bn to the country since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Moscow-backed separatists seized parts of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. About 13,000 people have been killed since the conflict erupted. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of funnelling troops and arms to the pro-Moscow rebels across the border. Moscow denies the allegations.
WASHINGTON: As tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine on the Black Sea, the US is upgrading several Ukrainian naval bases to give American and NATO warships the ability to dock just miles from Russia-controlled Crimea. Centered at the Ochakiv Naval Base and the military facility at Mykolaiv — 40 miles east of Odessa and less than 100 northwest of Crimea — the American-funded effort includes reinforcing and upgrading existing piers and adding a new floating dock, security fencing around the bases, ship repair facilities, and a pair of brand-new Maritime Operations Centers from which Ukrainian and NATO forces can direct exercises and coordinate activities. The upgrades come after last November’s incident where Russian warships fired on and seized three Ukrainian navy vessels in the Kerch Strait between Russia and Ukraine. Russia is still holding the crews. Google Maps graphic The US is building up Ukraine’s bases at Ocon the Black Sea coast, west of Russian-occupied Crimea. The new American effort in Ukraine will likely rankle Moscow. Since the Cold War, “the Russian military command has always held the fear that one day Ukraine would leave Russia and eventually there would be a NATO naval base on Moscow’s doorstep,” said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at CNA in Washington. “That fear led to Russia seizing and annexing Crimea, from which they could contest practically the entire Black Sea.” While Ukraine isn’t a NATO member, it does receive training from NATO forces and is currently hosting the annual Sea Breeze exercise that includes US and allied warships and several hundred Marines. From RAYTHEON The exercise and the US support comes in direct response to Russia’s military buildup in Crimea. Since taking it by force in 2014, Moscow has sent some of its most advanced military kit to the peninsula, including five S-400 anti-aircraft battalions, ten warships, six Kilo-class submarines, and new fighter aircraft, thereby allowing Moscow to project power across the Black Sea. Romania, which sits just 150 miles across the water from Crimea, is buying the Patriot air defense system from the US, and Romanian and American forces recently held a series of air defense drills in the Black Sea that simulated shooting down drones. Russia’s moves haven’t gone unnoticed in the rest of Europe. While visiting Washington earlier this year, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was discussing “what more we can do to enhance our security in the Black Sea region,” adding the allies had already agreed on “a package of measures to improve our situational awareness, and to step up our support for both Georgia and Ukraine.” The focus will be on training of maritime forces and coast guards, along with increased port visits and exercises. A majority of the effort is taking place at the Ochakiv, which has seen a series of visits from US Navy construction teams over the past few years. The work at Ochakiv won’t be wrapped up until August, Lt. Spencer Bull, operations officer for Underwater Construction Team 1 currently in Ukraine assessing the piers, told me. “The intent is to be able to use it for US and allied exercises,” he said, adding that his team of divers will work to reinforce existing piers, map out the seafloor to make sure bigger ships can dock there, and discuss where to place the planned floating dock.
The U.S. will continue cooperating with Ukraine to improve its defence capacity, as Special Representative to Ukraine said, Ukraine’s Embassy to the U.S. reports on Facebook. Volker noted that the U.S. was ready to work with Ukraine to provide it with defence lethal equipment. “Congress adopted international military funding which provides support for Ukraine in a form of different types of weapons including anti-tank and counter-sniper systems. We will continue consulting with Ukraine concerning its defence needs. Besides we are ready to military sales abroad, so Ukraine can purchase all military equipment from the U.S., Volker said at the briefing. ” According to him, Ukraine needs to enhance its defence capacity as the country comes under attacks daily so there is a need to prevent further occupation of the territories. The U.S. defence budget provides $100 million for Ukraine for lethal equipment. In particular, the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services approved the draft law “On the U.S. budget for 2020 for the needs of national security”, which authorized allocations to Pentagon for Ukraine in the amount of $300 million, which is by $50 million more. $100 million out of that sum is to be spent for lethal weaponry.
